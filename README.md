# Recipes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

Strapi is a free and open-source headless CMS delivering your content anywhere you need.
Keep control over your data. With Strapi, you know where your data is stored, and you keep full control at all times.
You can host and scale Strapi projects the way you want. You can choose any hosting platform you want: AWS, Render, Netlify, Heroku, a VPS, or a dedicated server. You can scale as you grow, 100% independent.
Strapi works with SQL databases. You can choose the database you prefer: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.
You can quickly build your logic by fully customizing APIs, routes, or plugins to fit your needs perfectly.

## Getting started
This repository is a starter with Angular for the frontend and Strapi for the backend.
Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. I use NPM to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from Here, then run npm install to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/arianrexhepii/Recipes.git
npm install
ng serve
```

After that you needed to clone the strapi repository: ` git clone https://github.com/arianrexhepii/recipes-cms.git `, next step is `npm install` to resolve all dependencies and the last is Run `npm run develop`.
```shell
 git clone https://github.com/arianrexhepii/recipes-cms.git
 npm install
 npm run develop
 ```
