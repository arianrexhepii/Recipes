Customizable. You can quickly build your logic by fully customizing APIs, routes, or plugins to fit your needs perfectly.

## Getting started
This repository is a starter with Angular for the frontend and Strapi for the backend.
Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. I use NPM to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from Here, then run npm install to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
After that you needed to clone the strapi repository: ` git clone https://github.com/arianrexhepii/recipes-cms.git `, next step is `npm install` to resolve all dependencies and the last is Run `npm run develop`.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
